        <p>
          This application reduces the time to a greater extent that is
          searching for the required blood through blood banks and hospitals.
          Thus this application provides the required information in less time
          and also helps in quicker decision making. Blood banking is the
          process that takes place in the lab to make sure that donated blood,
          or blood products, are safe before they are used in blood transfusions
          and other medical procedures. Blood banking includes typing the blood
          for transfusion and testing for infectious diseases.
